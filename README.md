# Unclosed Parenthesis in Python Function
This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Python: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code. The corrected version is in `bugSolution.py`.

The error itself is a syntax error, meaning the code won't even run.  The Python interpreter will throw a `SyntaxError` upon encountering this issue.  These are important to catch during development because they are easy to fix but can halt execution immediately.

**Key takeaway:** Always double-check for balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces in your code.  Consistent code formatting helps in this process.
